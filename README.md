# apple2fpga
Here you will find the DE2-115 implementation of the apple2fpga project from 
http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/apple2fpga/

The authors of the  original apple2fpga project:
Steve Edwards: Most of the code
Michel Stempin: Updated SD-card controller

My contribution to the DE2-115 are quite minimalistic:
* New pin-out for the DE2-115 board
* Minor modifications for the SD-card interface and VGA chip
* Use of Cyclone-IV PLL

The project was compiled with Quartus II v13.0
